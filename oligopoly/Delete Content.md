<p>The <b>Bertrand</b> model was proposed by Joseph Bertrand in 1883 as a criticism to the Cournot Model.  The model describes an oligopoly where firms strategically compete over prices.  The model makes the same assumptions as the Cournot model.  Bertrand noted that firms do not generally change their production quantities to compete but change their product's price level.  While it is agreed that this more closely approximates the mechanism by which a firm would compete given the presented situation, the objective function is dis-continuous, the predictions are sensitive to tie breaking rules and other non-strategic assumptions and the model does not coincide with observation.</p>
