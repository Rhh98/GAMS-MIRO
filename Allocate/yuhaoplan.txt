Take model allocate.gms and build an application in MIRO that incorporates it.

Issues to address:

1. Need for travel times (one possibility is google maps api as per Song Gao).
Maybe prespecify a number of routes between a lab and subsets of centers.

2. Data in simres should be replaced by simulation data from Vivak.  Note that most recent version allows different runtimes per lab, but also might want to index the data by a finite set of underlying prevalences too (that would be matched to kit prevalence information).   This will require updates to logic encoded in log0 - log6, etc.

3. Add ability to do multiple kits at a center as one "test" sent to the lab.  This changes prevalence.   Centers should have different underlying prevalances anyway (think hospital vs meat packing plant vs restaurant).

4. Add ability to do cheap (possibly inaccurate but fast) tests at centers as part of optimization choice.

5. How to produce output?   Maybe append all results to some database and allow access via queries.

Key design is to make this easy to understand and use.   Users should not see the underlying model.
